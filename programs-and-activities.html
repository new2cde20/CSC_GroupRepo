        <h3 style="color:#008998;">Cancer Caregivers</h3>
        <p>When someone in your life has cancer you are a caregiver. We think of caregivers as partners, famliy members, friends and co-<br>
            workers. A loved ones’ diagnosis has an impact on everyone involved. Caregiving can take an emotional and physical toll. We<br>
            have Caregiver Support groups, yoga for relaxation, a library full of information, counseling sessions to help you stay strong, and<br>
            more. Please look over our calendar for scheduled events and review the program options or call the Center to schedule a free<br>
            counseling session.
