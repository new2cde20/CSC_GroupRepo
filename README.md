# cancersocietyproject
This is a repo for my and my teammate's Software Engineering Capstone project at Lewis University.
My teammate and I will be making edits as necessary to this project.

To view the Sass Bourbon tables, you have to install Ruby (I have version 2.7.2 on my\
Windows machine that I downloaded from this website: https://rubyinstaller.org/ - if\
you are not using Windows you can Google "download Ruby" to install it based on your\
system), then install Sass Bourbon into the folder where your project is saved.\
The instructions to install Sass Bourbon from the command line can be found here:\
https://www.npmjs.com/package/bourbon#requirements

You can also view this video (where the user has a Mac laptop) to see how to install Bourbon on the command line (he installs Bourbon around the 2:25 mark of the video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5BO71n8Fbk

To learn more about Bourbon, you can view this page: https://codekitapp.com/help/bourbon/

In addition to this, you have to download PHP if you do not have a server with activated support for PHP (i.e., if you are running this code on your local machine). Check out the link here for more information on what's needed to view the PHP pages in this project: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_install.asp#:~:text=You%20do%20not%20need%20to,web%20hosts%20offer%20PHP%20support.

For further information on configuring PHP to send and receive emails (particularly on a web server on your own machine), check out the following Stack Overflow link here (this is information on the XAMPP server): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15965376/how-to-configure-xampp-to-send-mail-from-localhost/18185233#18185233
