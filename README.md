# cancersocietyproject
This is a repo for my Software Engineering Capstone project at Lewis University.
My teammates and I will be making edits as necessary to this project.

To view the Sass Bourbon tables, you have to install Ruby (I have version 2.7.2 on my\
Windows machine that I downloaded from this website: https://rubyinstaller.org/ - if\
you are not using Windows you can Google "download Ruby" to install it based on your\
system), then install Sass Bourbon into the folder where your project is saved.\
The instructions to install Sass Bourbon from the command line can be found here:\

You can also view this video (where the user has a Mac laptop) to see how to install Bourbon on the command line (he installs Bourbon around the 2:25 mark of the video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5BO71n8Fbk
