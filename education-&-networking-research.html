            <p>Over 13 million people are directly impacted by cancer in the United States (Howlader N, 
                Noone AM, Krapcho M, et al , 2010). One in 10 homes will receive a new diagnosis this year 
                alone. When considering their friends and families, that number grows exponentially. Each 
                month new diagnostic tests, treatments, and preventions surface in peer-reviewed professional 
                research journals. It should be no surprise that it would be of great benefit to those diagnosed 
                with cancer to be knowledgeable about the current research and practices. Doctors, as a part of 
                best practices, are increasingly collaborating with patients and designing treatment plans together. 
                Research has demonstrated that education and knowledge about oneâ€™s condition have a strong 
                relationship to seeking further support (Nekolaichuk, Cumming, Turner,Yushchyshyn, Sela & Rami, 2011).</p> 
                
            <p>Although there are many services available to support individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer, 
                there are many worries and issues that many oncology patients feel more comfortable discussing with 
                professionals and others who share the same diagnosis. It can be difficult to build support networks 
                when you are in the midst of distress; however, research indicates that the higher perceived level of 
                support has an inverse relationship to perceived stress (Koopman, Hermanson, Diamond, Angell, & Spiegel, 
                1998). More specifically, when exposed to greater life stress the relative level of social support can 
                act as a buffer from experience significant distress.

            </p>
                
            <p>Although one does not have to be in distress to benefit from building a strong network, as many as a quarter 
                of all individuals with cancer may have a psychiatric condition such as anxiety or mood disorder (Newell, 
                Sanson-Fisher, Girigis, & Askland, 1999 ). At the Cancer Support Center we strive to create support and 
                networking groups that are specifically designed to meet the particular needs of individuals as related to 
                diagnosis, stage, gender, and treatment options.  We utilize our existing local experts from community 
                partnerships to speak to our participants on relevant treatment, diagnosis, an prevention topics, as well 
                as ancillary service providers. We also recruit nationally renowned experts within the field of oncology 
                and support services who can offer our participants information and options that may not available in their 
                geographic area.</p>
