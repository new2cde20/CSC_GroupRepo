    <strong><i>"When my Dad got cancer, it was a weird feeling. I cannot really
        explain it. I try to keep happy<br>thoughts when I am sad. Talkng with Jason
        (my counselor at The Center) and seeing Champ<br>(a therapy dog that
        valunteers at The Center) helps make me happy."<br>
        -Ian, a 10-year-old-participant
    </i></strong>
    <p>A cancer diagnosis impacts the entire family. The Cancer Support Center is here so that no one walks the cancer journey alone. <br>
        With your support, we provide programs to children, families and adults to help them cope with the distress, anxiety and emotions <br> 
        that come with a diagnosis.<br><br>

        You can provide counseling sessions for individuals like Ian who need help navigating through this uncertain time in their lives. You <br>
        make it possible for pet therapy dogs like Champ to visit The Center as well as other stress management programs like art therapy, <br> 
        storytelling, guided imagery and massage. You allow women, men and children to participate in fitness classes, nutrition programs, <br>
        support groups and educational workshops specifically designed for anyone with cancer and their loved ones.<br><br>

        There is still time to make a difference this year. Your donation will provide programs and services to thousands of individuals with <br> 
        cancer through programs focused on counseling/stress management, fitness/physical wellness, nutrition, education, and body <br>

        <strong>The Center's service hours have increased more than 30% this year as compared to 2014.
            We need your help to serve this growing need.</strong><br><br>
