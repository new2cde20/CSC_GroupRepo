    <p>Let's Walk This Journey Together</p>
    <h3 style= "color:#008998;"> MISSION:</h3>
    <p>The Cancer Support Center is here to give strength, guidance, and support to anyone living with a<br>
        cancer diagnosis, as well as to their loved ones. We do this as a community-based, volunteer-driven,<br> 
        donor-supported organization. Our programs, resources, and services are always delivered by<br>
        professional therapists, counselors, nutritionists, and experts; and are provided in a warm, welcoming, <br>
        and nurturing setting at no cost to participants.
    </p>

    <h3 style= "color:#1e5477;"><strong>Center History:</strong></h3>
    <p>In 1992, Joan Hopkins and Judy Svancarek faced the challenges of cancer and realized the need for emotional support for <br> 
        themselves, their family and friends. They visited other support centers and were inspired by the educational lectures and support <br>
        groups. Joan and Judy listened to doctors and nurses and researched reports that attested to the positive effects that support <br>
        centers had on the immune system.  In an effort to gather community support and make this dream a reality, Joan and Judy <br>
        banded together with Judith Hanzelin, an oncology nurse, Carol VanTuyle, who worked in hospice, Jennifer Fallick and Patricia <br>
        McDonald, who had lost husbands to cancer, to become the driving force behind what is now known as The Cancer Support Center.<br>
        
        Today, The Cancer Support Center provides comprehensive supportive and wellness programs to thousands of people annually. <br>
        Everyone who comes to The Center is cared for – we do not have strict geographic limits and we do not limit how frequently <br>
        individuals can come to The Center for support. We are here to ease the burden of the cancer journey – from the beginning with <br>
        diagnosis through treatment and well after someone is “cancer-free”.<br><br>
        
        For many of our participants, they experience the emotional burden of their diagnosis and care well after their physical care is <br>
        provided. If you know of someone who is struggling with their cancer journey or loved on is in need of support, please encourage <br>
        them to stop by and meet with one of our program navigators so that they know that they are not alone. If you need us, please <br>
        come on in and let us work with you to find hope, help, and healing!
