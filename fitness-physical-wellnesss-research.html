            <p>Exercise and the expenditure of energy may be an important preventative factor 
                for some forms of cancer (Key, Schatzkin, Willett & Allen, 2004). Additionally, 
                moderate levels of exercise and physical activity have strong correlations to 
                improved recovery and longer-term survivorship in some cancer diagnoses (Lemanne, 
                Cassileth, & Gubili, 2013). As most oncology patients would attest, the treatment 
                side-effects of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy can be dramatic and severe. 
                In particular, the cognitive effects of chemotherapy, such as loss of focus and 
                difficulty with memory retrieval and  recall, sometimes referred to as “chemo 
                brain,” can be very troubling and hard to treat. Recent research has purported that 
                not only can physical exercise decrease the severity of cognitive impairment related 
                to chemotherapy, it can decrease the risk of falls and minor accidents, improve 
                emotional health, and improve the overall quality of life (Fitzpatrick, Edgar, & 
                Holcroft, 2012).</p> 
                
            <p>Unfortunately only 26% of oncology patients meet the suggested criteria for physical 
                activity (Peddle, Au, & Courneya, 2008). The good news is that research has found 
                that in as little as eight weeks oncology patients can make significant health 
                improvements and physical gains, such as weight gain/loss, increased strength, improved
                 mobility, and cardiovascular volume increase (Drake, Falzer, Xistris, Robinson, & 
                 Roberge, 2004).</p>
                
            <p>Based upon the gap between the pressing fitness needs and the availability of exercise 
                programs for the typical oncology patient, the Cancer Support Center has increased its 
                programming in this area. Individuals have access to multiple Yoga, Tai Chi, Massage, 
                Dance/Movement, and Walking classes that are spread out Monday through Saturday and are 
                all free of charge. Each class is led by qualified instructors who have multiple years of 
                experience working with chronic physical health issues such as cancer. Each program is 
                capped in size so that each instructor can have ample one-on-one time to personally assist 
                each member so that he or she can adjust the activity to a level of difficulty that is best 
                suited to diagnosis, stage, and personal ability.</p>

            <p>Currently we are looking to expand our access to fitness programs by partnering with some of 
                the agencies in the local townships that offer yoga, swimming, walking, aerobics, dance, and 
                cycling classes. Additionally, each of our classes is often offered adjacent to other nutritional, 
                counseling, or support programs.</p>
