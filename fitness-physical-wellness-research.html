    <p>Exercise and the expenditure of energy may be an important preventative factor for some forms of cancer (Key, Schatzkin, Willett & <br>
        Allen, 2004). Additionally, moderate levels of exercise and physical activity have strong correlations to improved recovery and <br>
        longer-term survivorship in some cancer diagnoses (Lemanne, Cassileth, & Gubili, 2013). As most oncology patients would attest, <br>
        the treatment side-effects of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy can be dramatic and severe. In particular, the cognitive effects of <br>
        chemotherapy, such as loss of focus and difficulty with memory retrieval and  recall, sometimes referred to as “chemo brain,” can <br> 
        be very troubling and hard to treat. Recent research has purported that not only can physical exercise decrease the severity of <br>
        cognitive impairment related to chemotherapy, it can decrease the risk of falls and minor accidents, improve emotional health, and <br>
        improve the overall quality of life (Fitzpatrick, Edgar, & Holcroft, 2012).

    <br><br>
    Unfortunately only 26% of oncology patients meet the suggested criteria for physical activity (Peddle, Au, & Courneya, 2008). The <br>
    good news is that research has found that in as little as eight weeks oncology patients can make significant health improvements <br>
    and physical gains, such as weight gain/loss, increased strength, improved mobility, and cardiovascular volume increase (Drake, <br>
    Falzer, Xistris, Robinson, & Roberge, 2004).
    <br><br>
    Based upon the gap between the pressing fitness needs and the availability of exercise programs for the typical oncology patient, <br>
    the Cancer Support Center has increased its programming in this area. Individuals have access to multiple Yoga, Tai Chi, Massage, <br>
    Dance/Movement, and Walking classes that are spread out Monday through Saturday and are all free of charge. Each class is led <br>
    by qualified instructors who have multiple years of experience working with chronic physical health issues such as cancer. Each <br>
    program is capped in size so that each instructor can have ample one-on-one time to personally assist each member so that he or <br>
    she can adjust the activity to a level of difficulty that is best suited to diagnosis, stage, and personal ability.
    <br><br>
    Currently we are looking to expand our access to fitness programs by partnering with some of the agencies in the local townships <br>
    that offer yoga, swimming, walking, aerobics, dance, and cycling classes. Additionally, each of our classes is often offered adjacent <br>
    to other nutritional, counseling, or support programs.
