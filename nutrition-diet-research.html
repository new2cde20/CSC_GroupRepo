    <p>For decades we have known that over 30% of cancers are thought to be primarily related to dietary concerns, making it second to<br>
        only tobacco as the most preventable (Doll & Peto, 1981). In developing countries, especially the United States, our population is<br>
        affected by these types of cancers at a substantially higher rate than our less Westernized counterparts. Nutritional guidance and <br>
        support may play a paramount role in both prevention and recovery in individuals’ cancer journeys.<br><br>

        Although every case of cancer is unique, research indicates that the most common troubling symptoms oncology patients will face<br>
        are fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and fluctuations in weight, all of which are strongly linked to nutrition and diet (Newell, Sanson-<br>
        Fisher, Girgis, & Ackland, 1999). No matter the stage or severity of the cancer prognosis, continued nutritional support consistently<br>
        shows improvement in individuals’ quality of life (Prevost & Grach, 2012).<br><br>

        We have custom designed programs to meet the needs of individuals with different diagnoses, who are at different stages, and who<br>
        may have other health concerns that need to be addressed alongside cancer. We offer each individual the chance to meet with a<br>
        nutrition educator in order to get one-to-one guidance and feedback on their daily diets. During these consultations, our nutritional<br>
        educator will research the individual’s diagnosis, current treatment concerns, preferences, and other health concerns to help<br>
        collaboratively create a nutritional plan that will meet the needs and taste of each individual.<br><br>

        In addition to our individual nutritional consultations we provide monthly cooking demonstrations where participants are allowed the<br>
        chance to practice their skills, interact and ask questions of trained professionals, and sample new items they may add to their<br>
        diets. We regularly offer seminars trainings where new techniques, interventions, and research are presented to our participants<br>
        and community partners. We offer a wide variety of resources to support such as books, audio cds, food journals, recipes, and<br>
        videos through our online and onsite libraries. Recently, we have also added nutritional support groups, as research favors <br>
        group efforts for managing weight and nutrition (Paul-Ebhohimhen & Avenell, 2009).<br><br>

        Currently, we are working to increase our partnerships with community businesses andorganizations to better support our<br>
        programming and make nutritional resources more widely available to all of our participants no matter their economic situation.
