        The Cancer Support Center hosts a range of body image related <br>
        activities including: wig boutiques, breast prosthetics, LGFB classes <br>
        (sponsored by the American Cancer Society), programs to address <br>
        incontinence and sexuality, and more.  Please review our newsletter to <br>
        see what body image programs might be useful to you and register today.

        A diagnosis of cancer ultimately involves a multitude of treatment <br>
        interventions that can include invasive surgeries, removal of tissue, and <br> 
        reconstruction. Additionally, radiation and chemotherapies can cause <br>
        significant bodily changes such as weight gain/loss, skin discoloration, <br>
        and hair loss. It should then not be surprising that these unwanted <br>
        changes can result in a fair amount of stress in the individual battling <br>
        cancer.  In head and neck cancers, for example, as many as 75 percent <br>
        of patients have been identified as having significant distress related to <br>
        their changing body image (Fubgeret, Yuan, Weston, Nipomnick, & Webber, 2012). In other cancers, such as prostate and breast, <br>
        individuals also experience moderate to severe levels of distress that have broadly reaching effects in multiple domains of <br>
        functioning (Prezdzeicki, Sherman, Baille, Taylor, Foley, &Stalgis-Bilinski, 2012). Recent literature also suggests that low self- <br>
        compassion and negative views of one’s body can correlate very strongly with over low quality of life scores on standardized <br>
        measures (Taylor-Ford, Meyerowitz, D’Orazio, Christie, Gross, & Agus, 2013).
        <br><br>

        For many individuals fighting or recovering from cancer the specific concerns of appearance, sexual functioning, and weight <br>
        gain/loss are large hurdles that often must be addressed by support services in order to improve the quality of (Prezdzeicki, <br>
        Sherman, Baille, Taylor, Foley, & Stalgis-Bilinski, 2012). The Cancer Support Center not only offers programs to help individuals <br>
        psychologically cope with these changes, but also programs that help them address the issues themselves. For instance, The <br>
        Cancer Support Center offers free wigs, wraps, hats, and hair pieces to individuals who are suffering from hair loss. For women, <br>
        The Center offers prosthetic devices to help alter their outward appearance.
        <br><br>
        Through the generosity of community partnerships and volunteers, The Center is able to refer men and women to local salons, <br>
        barbers, and nail salons that offer them free and discounted style services. We are also a proud partner with one long-standing and <br>
        successful program Look Good Feel Better, which offers makeovers and guidance to women who are coping with physical <br> 
        appearance changes related to cancer survivorship.
